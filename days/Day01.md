# Introduction to Cybersecurity

The **Internet of Things (IoT)** refers to the interconnection of digital devices through a vast network, enabling seamless communication and data exchange.

## What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting and recovering data, networks, devices, and programs from threats. These threats can originate from digital, human, or physical sources, each requiring specific safeguards.

### Components of Cybersecurity
1. **Digital Security**  
   Protects data and systems from digital threats, such as:
   - Malware (e.g., viruses, ransomware)
   - Hacking attempts to steal sensitive information  
   **Examples of Controls**:
   - Firewalls
   - Encryption software

2. **Human Security**  
   Mitigates risks arising from human behavior, which can be:
   - **Unintentional**: e.g., downloading a malicious email attachment
   - **Intentional**: e.g., leaking confidential data  
   **Examples of Controls**:
   - Employee security training
   - Strong password policies

3. **Physical Security**  
   Safeguards tangible assets supporting digital infrastructure (e.g., workstations, server rooms, data centers) against threats like theft, tampering, or natural disasters.  
   **Examples of Controls**:
   - Surveillance systems
   - Access control measures
   - Disaster recovery plans

## The CIA Triad
The **CIA triad**—**Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability**—forms the cornerstone of effective cybersecurity.

### Confidentiality
Ensures data remains private and accessible only to authorized individuals.  
**Example**: Healthcare providers protect patient data (e.g., diagnoses, prescriptions) using safeguards to grant appropriate access to the right users at the right time.

### Integrity
Maintains data accuracy and trustworthiness by preventing unauthorized modifications or destruction. Integrity overlaps with confidentiality in restricting unauthorized access.  
**Example**: Banks prioritize integrity to ensure the accuracy of financial transactions.

### Availability
Guarantees timely and reliable access to data and services.  
**Examples**:
- Online banking requires 24/7 availability.
- School transcripts may take days to process but remain accessible within a reasonable timeframe.  
**Note**: Downtime for online retailers can lead to lost customers and reputational damage.

### Prioritizing CIA Objectives
Organizations prioritize CIA objectives based on their needs:
- **Government Intelligence Agencies**: Prioritize **confidentiality** for sensitive national security data.
- **Banks**: Focus on **integrity** for accurate financial records.
- **Online Retailers**: Emphasize **availability** to ensure uninterrupted customer access.

## Security Controls for the CIA Triad
Controls are safeguards or countermeasures designed to mitigate security risks to physical, tangible, or digital assets.

### Controls for Confidentiality
- **Encryption**: Converts data into a secure format readable only with a decryption key.
- **Access Controls**: Use passwords or biometrics (e.g., fingerprints, retinal scans) to restrict access.
- **Patch Management**: Regularly updates software to fix vulnerabilities exploitable by attackers.

### Controls for Integrity
- **Checksums**: Generate unique values to detect data alterations.
- **Access Controls and User Permissions**: Restrict who can modify data and what changes are allowed.
- **Data Backups**: Enable restoration of data to its original state.
- **Audit Trails**: Record changes to data, including who made them and when.

### Controls for Availability
- **Redundant Systems and Backups**: Prevent data loss or system failure.
- **Antimalware Software and Firewalls**: Protect against attacks that disrupt services.
- **Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plans**: Minimize downtime by outlining steps for rapid service restoration.

## Key Elements of Cybersecurity
Securing information assets requires a holistic approach focusing on three key elements:

### Education
Regular training builds a "human firewall" by teaching employees about cybersecurity and their role in threat prevention.  
**Example**: Training sessions to identify phishing emails.

### Process
Well-defined processes integrate security into every step of operations. Effective processes are:
- Clear and user-friendly
- Accessible and well-communicated
- Consistent across the organization

### Technology
Encompasses infrastructure like:
- Device encryption
- Network perimeter defenses
- Antimalware technologies

## Risk Management
A **risk** is the potential for an event with negative consequences. The risk value is calculated as:  
**Risk Value = Consequence × Likelihood**

- **Consequence**: The impact and damages caused by the risk.
- **Likelihood**: The probability of the risk occurring, influenced by:
  - **Adversary Capability**: The attacker’s resources, technology, and expertise.
  - **Adversary Motivation**: The incentive driving the attack.
  - **Vulnerability Severity**: Exploitable weaknesses in a system.

### Risk Responses
Organizations can choose one of four responses:
1. **Acceptance**: Acknowledge and prepare for potential consequences.
2. **Reduction**: Implement controls to lower likelihood or consequence.
3. **Transference**: Shift risk to a third party via insurance or outsourcing.
4. **Rejection**: Avoid activities that introduce the risk, potentially altering operations.

### Risk Appetite
Defines the level of risk an organization is willing to accept:
- **High Risk Appetite**: Accepts significant risks.
- **Low Risk Appetite**: Prefers minimal risk exposure.

## Laws and Ethics
### Cybersecurity Laws
- **Unauthorized Use or Control**: Prohibits unapproved access to devices (e.g., fake login screens to steal passwords).
- **Preventing Legitimate Use**: Addresses attacks on resource availability (e.g., overloading servers with data packets).
- **Aiding Criminals or Designing Malware**: Bans assisting cybercrimes or creating malicious software (e.g., remote access tools without consent).
- **Unauthorized Data Alteration**: Prevents unauthorized changes or deletions (e.g., altering financial records).
- **Prohibited Software**: Outlaws creating or distributing software for cybercrimes (e.g., malware in email attachments).
- **Cyberstalking and Harassment**: Curbs harmful online behavior (e.g., threatening messages via social media).

**Golden Rule**: Always obtain permission or appropriate access from the device owner before experimenting.

### Ethical Considerations
- **Retaliation**: Debates surround "hack back" or active defense, where victims attempt to identify or disrupt attackers.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Raises concerns about accountability, transparency, and potential misuse in cybersecurity.
- **Government Use**: Balancing national security with individual privacy sparks ethical debates about government surveillance.
