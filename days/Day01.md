# 📖 Day 01 – Introduction to Cybersecurity  

The **Internet of Things (IoT)** refers to the interconnection of digital devices through a vast network, enabling seamless communication and data exchange.  

---

## 🔒 What is Cybersecurity?  
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting and recovering data, networks, devices, and programs from threats.  
These threats can originate from **digital, human, or physical** sources, each requiring specific safeguards.

## 🧩 Components of Cybersecurity  

### 1️⃣ Digital Security  
Protects data and systems from digital threats, such as:  
- 🦠 Malware (e.g., viruses, ransomware)  
- 🕵️‍♂️ Hacking attempts to steal sensitive information  

**Examples of Controls**:  
- 🔥 Firewalls  
- 🔐 Encryption software  

### 2️⃣ Human Security  
Mitigates risks arising from human behavior, which can be:  
- ❌ **Unintentional** → downloading a malicious email attachment  
- ⚠️ **Intentional** → leaking confidential data  

**Examples of Controls**:  
- 🎓 Employee security training  
- 🔑 Strong password policies  

### 3️⃣ Physical Security  
Safeguards tangible assets (workstations, server rooms, data centers) against theft, tampering, or natural disasters.  

**Examples of Controls**:  
- 📹 Surveillance systems  
- 🚪 Access control measures  
- 🌐 Disaster recovery plans

## 🔑 The CIA Triad  
The **CIA triad** — **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability** — forms the cornerstone of effective cybersecurity.  

### 🔐 Confidentiality  
Ensures data remains private and accessible only to authorized individuals.  
- **Example**: Healthcare providers protect patient data with controlled access.  

### 🧾 Integrity  
Maintains data accuracy and trustworthiness by preventing unauthorized changes or destruction.  
- **Example**: Banks prioritize integrity to ensure financial transaction accuracy.  

### 📡 Availability  
Guarantees timely and reliable access to data and services.  
- **Examples**:  
  - 24/7 online banking access  
  - School transcripts available within a reasonable timeframe  

**Organizational Priorities**:  
- 🕵️ Government agencies → **Confidentiality**  
- 🏦 Banks → **Integrity**  
- 🛒 Online retailers → **Availability**

## 🛡️ Security Controls for the CIA Triad  

### 🔐 Controls for Confidentiality  
- Encryption (data unreadable without key)  
- Access controls (passwords, biometrics)  
- Patch management (regular updates)  

### 🧾 Controls for Integrity  
- Checksums (detect data alterations)  
- Access permissions (limit modifications)  
- Backups (restore correct data)  
- Audit trails (log changes & users)  

### 📡 Controls for Availability  
- Redundant systems & backups  
- Antimalware & firewalls  
- Disaster recovery & business continuity plans  

---

## 🏗️ Key Elements of Cybersecurity  

### 🎓 Education  
Build a “human firewall” with regular training.  
- Example: phishing awareness sessions.  

### ⚙️ Process  
Effective processes are:  
- ✅ Clear  
- 📖 Well-communicated  
- ♻️ Consistent  

### 💻 Technology  
Infrastructure includes:  
- Device encryption  
- Network perimeter defenses  
- Antimalware solutions

## 📊 Risk Management  

**Risk Value = Consequence × Likelihood**  

- **Consequence** → Impact/damages  
- **Likelihood** → Probability of occurrence, influenced by:  
  - 💪 Adversary capability  
  - 🎯 Adversary motivation  
  - 🪲 Vulnerability severity  

### 🛠️ Risk Responses  
1. ✅ Acceptance → Prepare for consequences  
2. 🔧 Reduction → Lower likelihood/impact  
3. 🤝 Transference → Outsource/insure  
4. ⛔ Rejection → Avoid risky activity  

**Risk Appetite** → Willingness to accept risk  
- 🔴 Low → Avoid risk  
- 🟢 High → Accept more risk  

---

## ⚖️ Laws and Ethics  

### 📜 Cybersecurity Laws  
- 🚫 Unauthorized use/control → fake login screens  
- 🌐 DoS attacks → overloading servers  
- 🛠️ Aiding crimes → malware creation/distribution  
- 🪙 Data alteration → financial database tampering  
- 📂 Prohibited software → infected email attachments  
- 💬 Cyberstalking/harassment → threats online  

👉 **Golden Rule**: Always obtain permission before experimenting.  

### 🤔 Ethical Considerations  
- Retaliation → debate on “hack back”  
- Artificial Intelligence → transparency & misuse concerns  
- Government Surveillance → balance security vs privacy
